Then It takes me to the console page:
Here I have created the bucket name called "saitejabucket5533"

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4d72b23-6c42-4836-8bd3-94eec8ac3a7c)

After that I created the folders in bucket:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83085aa8-0c99-4559-ab92-4e750ba341c1)

I uploaded a file that folder:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8443fe4a-86e8-43a5-b222-8e0f45fae865)

Then I login to Iam page:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cb8e9bb-94ad-43fd-a970-9fc7de0f7741)

I created A user name called "Saiteja"

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa966cb4-39fd-4726-8bfc-3670b8133ab1)

I also created the roles here:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2014ea17-17c2-4d6b-8f6b-04b91de7ba8a)

So this is what I have done in AWS Console

# AWS S3 Command Prompt:

Here I Gave the commands like aws, aws configure, aws access key id, aws secret access key,

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/905a14ca-ceda-4f31-9cd4-156a8c3cc0cf)

Then I gave the commands like aws s3 Is, 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d3c6c51-20f2-47cb-ae1b-d9c826475b1d)

Then going to coding:

# AWS S3 coding:
Here I gave the code :
That's all for the S3 Services.

# IAM (Identity and Access Management):
# What is IAM:
AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a service that helps you securely manage users, groups, roles, and permissions in AWS. It ensures that only authorized users and services can access AWS resources.

# Purpose of IAM:
AWS IAM is essential for securing AWS resources and managing user access. It has some purposes like Authentication & Authorization, Granular Access Control, Secure API & CLI Access, Cross-Account Access, Service-to-Service Authentication, Compliance & Auditing. 

# IAM Console:
First of all I login to IAM console:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f2a8685-c1d0-47b2-b687-6dd7ac608bac)


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09b4f213-d5de-4084-b0f6-2b29254a0ead)

Then It takes me to console page of IAM:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12ce99c7-c3f3-4767-b6a9-74cd12bd3fa1)

Then I went to the users to create a new user:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ceb5425f-5187-4d6f-b2dc-70804451acb1)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4df95771-1db4-4f07-aca2-6083844c5f8d)

You could see successfully created the user:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0858d019-0f7f-499e-bb87-42af6721097d)

Then I moved to security credentials:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9feaafcb-2cf7-4b93-9ba1-b3289fd3dc1d)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0d5581e-bd5f-436d-8582-165853264e2f)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7a79bed-23d1-47ad-ad35-0d4f816c7d74)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2deac6f3-97a2-4934-86f7-f8a6f05380e7)

Then After that I opened new incognito window to IAM console by using the credentials I have created recently:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6702aafa-99e4-4614-972b-eb619ae1deef)

So if you could see here the permission for that has been denied:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32dbde3a-a2e1-42d4-9e3b-b3bc5c78c848)

But in S3 it has the permission:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4142f137-4fa9-4801-bf10-4d88bd241f5c)

Then in IAM I went to policies:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94a50455-b698-4157-b4cf-57de16a6a141)

Here I created the policies:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63b16606-40f7-47d4-aafe-db7f34421cb7)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d9be453-2e5b-4f63-813b-a38100c72576)

I made some code changes here:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cf3d455-ca00-4b6b-acd6-4658dc6623f0)

I gave name to the policies:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77bcee31-bea5-4756-94df-a9d12d8764b0)

Here the policies has been createed:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/392472b0-00ac-4415-9ab2-7ce53b3affa1)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eca61bf6-5e2e-4e99-8fec-99c530c66f53)

Then I moved to permissions:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/049ebf70-1e51-472a-bdd0-27597c3231e8)

I gave the permissions to it:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31b429a4-e570-4de7-b0d4-0f1fd34b6e63)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71e32892-2a2b-4611-bce5-82b854402441)

Then I checked the s3 incognito mode:
I see the permission got success:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c487e15b-0f3e-4434-80c1-961167adc9ec)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b883a02c-c710-4d5e-9b1b-f9d387c6e653)

Then I remove the policies create the user groups:


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fc80b01-5309-42d2-b17e-ac646c897d4e)


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45f3d0a4-42c8-4ff5-b9bd-13123aea3486)

If I check for the permission in s3 then it got denied again:


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a79bdcb1-e855-46b6-8522-9b2f9f7fae20)

Now I created the group in IAM:


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cb508b8-d446-471a-8c89-a67fe2b0b330)


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f7be61b-e134-4c16-a988-d92c0720b7c9)


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/20689800-073f-4149-bc95-5f60059adc79)


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/891a0248-e6a9-4f05-bd1e-fc1faf10de88)

Then I again gave the permission:


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65e44a43-b207-4d53-ac39-64a301b688fd)


![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e09b78ec-e33f-4bfd-8d80-d164ef828160)

That's all for IAM:
